# chat V6

 6th iteration of my chat app (some are private)

## Usage

Then run the client and enter your username in the prompt. This should be the same one as the one you sent me.

You should be able to chat now!

There are 2 commands (client side):

```syntax
- /nick <name>         - Set your nickname
- /msg  <name> <msg>   - Send a private message
```

## PLUGIN SUPPORT COMING SOON
